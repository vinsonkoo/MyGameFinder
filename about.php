			<h3>The creators of MyGameFinder, Aaron and Brad, are avid sports fans who attended North Carolina State University. As followers of Wolfpack athletics who no longer live in Raleigh, they became frustrated trying to find which channel various games were being broadcast. They quickly realized that with so many channels and television providers across the country, many sports fans were struggling to find their favorite teams too. 
			<br><br>
			MyGameFinder was created to solve this problem. The website (and application coming soon) allows fans to quickly and easily find their favorite team, on any television provider, anywhere in the country. Aaron and Brad look forward to helping make sure you never miss a second of the action</h3>
